## More Examples

### Custom Hooks

You can use the custom hooks provided by the `<ResizeDetector>` to consume the dimensions, or tshirt "size" value (`small` | `medium` | `large`) in a child component of the `<ResizeDetector>`.

```jsx
import ResizeDetector, { useResizeDetector } from "@paprika/resize-detector";

function ResizeConsumer() {
  const { width, height, breakpointSize } = useResizeDetector();

  return (
    <ColourfulBox>
      {width} x {height}
      <br />
      [{breakpointSize}]
    </ColourfulBox>
  );
}

function ResizeApp() {
  return (
    <ResizeDetector>
      <ResizeConsumer />
    </ResizeDetector>;
  );
}
```

#### Result

<BasicStory />

<br />

---

### FullWidth / FullHeight

By default, the `<ResizeDetector>` has its `isFullWidth` prop set to `true`, giving it the rendering behaviour of a block level element. However, this `isFullWidth` can be set to `false` so that it will wrap to the contents of its children and behave like an `inline-block` element.

It also has an `isFullHeight` prop, which will cause it to expand to the height of its container which may be useful for detecting the `height`.

#### Result

<FullHeightStory />

### Breakpoints

The `breakpointSize` value that is provided is a t-shirt size (`small` | `medium` | `large`) which is determined by two breakpoints: `breakpointSmall` + `breakpointLarge`.

The `breakpointSmall` is the pixel value of the container width at which the `breakpointSize` value "breaks" _from_ `small` to `medium`.

The `breakpointLarge` is the pixel value of the container width at which the `breakpointSize` value "breaks" from `medium` _to_ `large`.

If either of these is set to `0` or `null`, then that breakpoint will be ignored, and the corresponding `breakpointSize` will never be applied.

#### Custom Breakpoints

```jsx
<ResizeDetector breakpointSmall={100} breakpointLarge={200}>
  <ResizeConsumer />
</ResizeDetector>
```

#### Result

<CustomBreakpointsStory />

#### No Small Breakpoint

```jsx
<ResizeDetector breakpointSmall={0} breakpointLarge={200}>
  <ResizeConsumer />
</ResizeDetector>
```

#### Result

<NoSmallStory />

#### No Large Breakpoint

```jsx
<ResizeDetector breakpointSmall={100} breakpointLarge={null}>
  <ResizeConsumer />
</ResizeDetector>
```

#### Result

<NoLargeStory />

### Callbacks

The `<ResizeDetector>` has two callback props, `onBreak` and `onResize`. Similar to the custom hooks, they provide the `breakpointSize` value and the `width` / `height` values, respectively.

These callbacks may be useful for triggering an event, like fetching data or displaying a Modal.

```jsx
<ResizeDetector
  onBreak={breakpointSize => {
    showToast(breakpointSize);
  }}
>
  <ResizeConsumer />
</ResizeDetector>
```

#### Result

<OnBreakStory />

### Debounce Examples

<p>
  By default, the updates emitted by the <code>&lt;ResizeDetector&gt;</code> are debounced with a delay of
  {30} ms, but this can be controlled with the <code>debounceDelay</code> prop.
</p>

```jsx
<ResizeDetector debounceDelay={30}>
  <ResizeConsumer />
</ResizeDetector>
```

#### Result

<DebounceSlowStory />

```jsx
<ResizeDetector debounceDelay={0}>
  <ResizeConsumer />
</ResizeDetector>
```

#### Result

<DebounceFastStory />
