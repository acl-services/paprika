## Usage

```js
import { UploaderContext } from "@paprika/uploader/lib/Uploader"

function YourUI() {
  const {
    /*provided by context*/
    cancelFile,
    FileInput,
    files,
    isCompleted,
    isDisabled,
    isDraggingOver,
    isDragLeave,
    removeFile,
    upload,
  } = React.useContext(UploaderContext);

  return (
    <>
      <FileInput>
        <div css={yourStyle}>FILE INPUT ZONE</div>
      </FileInput>
      {files.length ? (
        <ul>
          {files.map(file => (
            <li>{file.filename}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      ) : null}
    </>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Uploader>
     <YourUI />
    </Uploader>;
  )
}
```

### Note

#### maxFileSize

Size in Mebibytes which is used for comparing each file that will be uploaded
you can make use of Uploader.convertUnitsToMebibytes() for easily converting units to Mebibyes
ex. Uploader.convertUnitsToMebibytes(4) => 4194304 (close to 4MB);

#### headers:

You can pass an array of header objects ex.

```js
   <Uploader headers={[{ "API-Key": "your-api-key" }, { Accept: "application/json" }, { "X-CSRF-Token": "your-token"} ]} ...>
     {({...}) => <YourUI />}
   </Uploader>
```

### Context

`import { UploaderContext } from "@paprika/uploader";`

- **children** you can pass a component which can consume the Context provided.
- **FileInput**
  The input[type="file"] element ready to be consumed
- **files**
  A enhance list of the user selected files
- **isCompleted**
  Is true when all files have been processed
- **isDisabled**
  Describe the status of the component
- **isDragLeave**
  Will be true if a dragOver event occurred and leave the droppable area
- **isDraggingOver**
  Is `True` when detecting the user is dragging files over the droppable area
- **removeFile**
  `removeFile(key)` will remove a file from the files list, this function doesn't work while the file is on _PROCESSING_ state.
- **cancelFile**
  `cancelFile(key)` stop the request cycle keep in mind that if it's on _WAITINGFORSERVER_ state the server might save the file even if - the request has been cancel
- **upload**
  `upload()` give you the option to manually upload the files if the consumer decided to not use _hasAutoUpload_

### FileInput Component

The `<FileInput>{children}</FileInput>` is a ready to use component which is passed down by the `<Uploader />` context.
This component has attached accessibility and attributes required to make it work correctly, you can pass any children to beautify their aspect, keep in mind that is already an input[type='file'] so avoid putting a `<Button />` component or a `<button />` element as a children, just make it look like one.

### Endpoint

The _Uploader_ provides a `endpoint` prop which you can use to point the url of the service you want to reach, Ex.
`<Uploader endpoint="https://yoururl.com/api/upload" ...`

### Accessibility

The Uploader automatically handle the on focus circle when using the `<FileInput />` component on it.

- it should notify when start uploading the files and when finishing processing the files.
