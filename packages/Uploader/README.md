|onChange|func|false|() => {}| This callback fires every time a file has been processed|
|onCompleted|func|false|() => {}| Will be fire once all files has been processed with the files as parameter, finishing doesn't mean that all
files has been correctly uploaded, only means that they were processed, to find about the state of each file
iterate over the files list.|
|headers|arrayOf|false|[]| you can pass an array of header objects as need it ex.
<Uploader headers={[{ "API-Key": "your-api-key" }, { Accept: "application/json" }, { "X-CSRF-Token": "your-token"} ]} ...>
{({...}) => <YourUI />}
</Uploader>|

     <YourUI />
    </Uploader>;
  )
}
```
### Note

#### maxFileSize
Size in Mebibytes which is used for comparing each file that will be uploaded
you can make use of Uploader.convertUnitsToMebibytes() for easily converting units to Mebibyes
ex.  Uploader.convertUnitsToMebibytes(4) => 4194304 (close to 4MB);

#### headers:
 You can pass an array of header objects ex.
 ```js
    <Uploader headers={[{ "API-Key": "your-api-key" }, { Accept: "application/json" }, { "X-CSRF-Token": "your-token"} ]} ...>
      {({...}) => <YourUI />}
    </Uploader>
  ```

### Context

`import { UploaderContext } from "@paprika/uploader";`

- **children** you can pass a component which can consume the Context provided.
- **FileInput**
  The input[type="file"] element ready to be consumed
- **files**
  A enhance list of the user selected files
- **isCompleted**
  Is true when all files have been processed
- **isDisabled**
  Describe the status of the component
- **isDragLeave**
  Will be true if a dragOver event occurred and leave the droppable area
- **isDraggingOver**
  Is `True` when detecting the user is dragging files over the droppable area
- **removeFile**
  `removeFile(key)` will remove a file from the files list, this function doesn't work while the file is on _PROCESSING_ state.
- **cancelFile**
  `cancelFile(key)` stop the request cycle keep in mind that if it's on _WAITINGFORSERVER_ state the server might save the file even if - the request has been cancel
- **upload**
  `upload()` give you the option to manually upload the files if the consumer decided to not use _hasAutoUpload_

### FileInput Component

The `<FileInput>{children}</FileInput>` is a ready to use component which is passed down by the `<Uploader />` context.
This component has attached accessibility and attributes required to make it work correctly, you can pass any children to beautify their aspect, keep in mind that is already an input[type='file'] so avoid putting a `<Button />` component or a `<button />` element as a children, just make it look like one.

### Endpoint

The _Uploader_ provides a `endpoint` prop which you can use to point the url of the service you want to reach, Ex.
`<Uploader endpoint="https://yoururl.com/api/upload" ...`

### Accessibility

The Uploader automatically handle the on focus circle when using the `<FileInput />` component on it.

- it should notify when start uploading the files and when finishing processing the files.
