## [0.3.11] - 2020-01-21

### Added

- `isPortal` prop that controls if a popover is rendered inline with the DOM or as a React portal element
- Note: The prop added is only used with caution as it can cause indesirable behaviour with paprika side panels / modals.
- This was added to help with using the Popover component in legacy code where rendering it as portal element will cause the
- popover not to be rendered.
