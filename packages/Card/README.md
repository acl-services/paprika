## Card

The <Card> component is a customizable content container. It comes with subcomponents that allow for quick and easy creation of various card types for different use cases. Additionally any other child elements can be passed into the Card.

### Usage

To create a card simply add the  ```<Card></Card>``` element. You can set the card to one the of three preset sizes (small, medium, and large) or alternatively you can add a isFullWidth or isAutoHeight property to the card. You can then add several children elements of your choice or use one of the many subcomponents to create your card.

Note: When using the size property the width and height are fixed therefore consideration will have to be given to size of content passed into the Card.

```js
<Card size="medium">
    <Card.Header>
        <Avatar isRandomBackground>E</Avatar>
    </Card.Header>
    <Card.Content>
        <Card.Title>Example</Card.Title>
        <Card.Metadata>metadata</Card.Metadata>
        <Card.Seperator size="small" />
        <Card.Text>This is an example of a medium sized Card</Card.Text>
        <Card.Seperator size="small" />
        <Card.Metadata>Created by Kaan</Card.Metadata>
        <Card.Metadata>Last updated by Karen</Card.Metadata>
    </Card.Content>
    <Card.Footer>
        <div
        style={{
            display: "flex",
            flexDirection: "row",
            justifyContent: "space-between",
            alignItems: "center",
        }}
        >
        <span>150 attributes</span>

        </div>
    </Card.Footer>
