# Changelog

## 2.2.1-next.0

### Patch Changes

- 7979fb6: Add null to defaultIndex and index proptype

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e00afcc: #### Added

  - Capability for tab list to be rendered with no active tab.
  - Applied expected ARIA attributes throughout.

  #### Changed

  - Refactored keyboard usage patterns – allow focus on disabled tabs and ensure focus movement and user interactions adhere to expected standards.
  - Default props for `index` and `defaultIndex` have both been changed to `undefined`. This is NOT considered a breaking change as behaviour should remain the same (omitting `defaultIndex` still results in a selected first tab – unless first tab is disabled).
