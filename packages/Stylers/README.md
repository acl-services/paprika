# @paprika/stylers

## Description

The `stylers` package is a companion for the `tokens` package, they are both implementations of the [Starling Design System](https://design.wegalvanize.com/) for use in styling user interfaces. The `stylers` are more than just simple values however, they are helper functions and bundles of CSS rules.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @paprika/stylers
```

or with npm:

```sh
npm install @paprika/stylers
```

## Usage

`stylers` are intended for use **internally and externally**.

Internally, when contributors create Paprika components, and externally, when application developers consume Paprika to create user interfaces with the Starling Design System.

### Consumers

Typically consumers will be using tokens with Sass. They can be included in any Sass file with:

```scss
@import "@paprika/stylers/lib/helpers.scss";
```

Then you should be able to use Sass functions like `font-size()` and `spacer()` as well as mixins like `@include truncate-text;` and `@include focus-ring(true)`.

### Contributors

For scalability, in implementation of the `stylers` is split into:

- `includes.js` and `formIncludes.js` (for bundles of styling rules)
- `helpers.js` (functions that take an input and generate a value or styling rule/rules).
