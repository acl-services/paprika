# Paprika

## Getting started

Our list of components can be find for now at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/paprika).

Paprika has a `peerDependecy` of [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#installation) so make sure to install it as a dependency in your project.

All paprika components can be installed as:

```sh
  npm install @paprika/ComponentToConsume
```

or

```sh
  yarn add @paprika/ComponentToConsume
```

That's all you are ready to go from here you can:

For debugging your jest test via chrome, just run the command below, [more info](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/08/24/How-to-debug-jest-tests/)

```sh
  yarn test:debug
```

### run docz

```sh
$ yarn docz:dev
```

for building it

```sh
$ yarn docz:build
```

### minimum requirements

#### yarn version

yarn v1.12.3 (which contains yarn audit command) or update via:

```sh
$ brew install yarn
```

#### node version

v10.0.0 which is required by `eslint`

### Build <L10n> Translations

The L10n component uses only JavaScript functions -- no YAML parsing is needed. To accomplish this, the `prepublish` build step [will] converts the .yml files to .js files. If you'd like to run this translation manually, run:

```sh
$ yarn translate
```
