# Pestle - A Paprika CLI for Contributors

### Purpose

The purpose of this Paprika Command Line Interface project is to develop an organized and automated way to help develop and maintain @paprika components without needing to remember all the rules and structures in the repository.

### Getting Started

- In the root of the paprika repository you can start the CLI by running `yarn pestle`
- From there, you can use the interactive prompting to either - Create a new component which will generate boilerplate for the component, stories, and tests files. - Add tests or stories to an existing component
- You can start the storybook by `yarn storybook` to see the new component stub and tinker on from there.
